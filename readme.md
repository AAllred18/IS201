23.6 Final Web Development Project
For this portion of the final, you’re going to build a super awesome professional-looking website based on the Bootstrap technique taught in the last chapter of this module. For your own sake, please use one of the free themes available on startbootstrap.com (rather than a paid theme or a theme you find on another bootstrap site). This part is naturally open-book, open-internet, etc. as long as the work is yours. As with the VBA exam and project, you will self-grade this portion after it is submitted.

We have intentionally kept the requirements for this website somewhat loose so that you could feel free to be creative and build something you really care about. However, you must build a new site for this project. You cannot use a site you (or anyone else) had built previously, and you cannot collaborate on building a site with anyone in or out of the class. This must be a new site you created specifically for this project. Nevertheless, you can certainly build something that is useful outside of the course. We strongly recommend you build your site starting with a Bootstrap theme. A professional-looking page (or pages) is required. Your site must also include at least one page that is crafted entirely from scratch (requirements below) to demonstrate your understanding of and ability to implement the course content. Also, if you are a graduate student, please notice the additional requirements at the end. 

Requirements:

In general:
- The site must be professional in appearance. We will deduct points for clear aesthetic errors anywhere on your site that reduce readability or are distracting. These include, but are not limited to:
    blue text on red background is atrocious
    animated gif backgrounds are horrific
    red text on gray background is impossible to read
- The site must be hosted online (e.g., via GitHub pages as shown in the previous section).
- The site must not have any broken content: images, links, videos, etc.
- The site must include a resume portion created in HTML (not as a PDF). This should be a useful resume with good information organized in an easy-to-access way. Useful information includes your education, work experience, skills, and possibly some awards or honors that distinguish you. You do not need to include your contact information unless you want to. The resume content can appear in your professional pages or your scratch page, or both.

From-scratch page:
- This page must be created from a blank HTML file.
    It can be about anything. Pick a hobby, or a passion, or something that fascinates you.
It must include the following as a demonstration of your ability to write HTML and CSS:
- An unordered list embedded in an ordered list
- At least one image (not from the Bootstrap theme)
- An embedded YouTube video (we intentionally didn’t teach you this, so you would have to Google this—good learning experience)
- An on-page anchor
- A custom background color or image

You also need to link to (and apply) a stylesheet that you have created from scratch. This stylesheet should include:
- At least four style definitions (it is possible you will have many more than four styles)
- Styles that specify font color
- Styles that specify font family
- At least three divs that are positioned and styled using your styles
- A live and interactive embedded Tableau graph (not just a picture of one).
    This graph can be about anything. It doesn’t have to be a graph you created, although it certainly can be.
    A quick Google search will show you where to find cool Tableau visualizations.
- Navigation back to the professional-looking pages.
Your professional-looking pages do not need to link to this page. This way you can use the professional side for whatever you want without worrying someone might find this DIY page…
