Andrew Allred Personal Website

Hi, Iâ€™m AJ Allred, a junior at BYU studying Information Systems, with a focus on front-end website development. I have experience working as a front-end developer at the Sorensen Center, where I created user-friendly and responsive web applications. Here is a simple website I created through my IS201 course at Brigham Young University. 

This website consists of several sections listing my education, experience, skills, and life facts. Feel free to explore the beginning point of my front-end website development experience.
